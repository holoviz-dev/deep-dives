    "The addition of `.rx` in Param has made certain operation a lot easier, particularly when working with data pipelines, to others they are still quite mysterious. In this deep dive we will discover why they were added, how they fit into the HoloViz reactivity model and then unpack how they work internally. \n",

    "## What are the benefits of reactivity?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is **data-driven**, i.e. the UI updates automatically in response to changes in the data model. In Excel the data model is represented by value of a cell, while React uses state hooks. In Panel the data model is defined by \"Parameters\". Each component and user class defines some parameters, and changes in the parameter values drive changes in the UI. In all these frameworks, automatic updates are achieved by what we will call **data binding**, how precisely this works will be the primary focus of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It is **declarative**, which means that the user defines what should be rendered, while the reactive framework figures out how to efficiently make the required updates. In Excel this process is relatively simple; Excel simply has to re-evaluate any formulas that depend on the changed inputs, and then update those cells' output. In React this involves something called the virtual DOM and involves \"diffing\" of the document model and then figuring out the most efficient updates to reflect the latest changes. In Panel the update process works either by defining a function whose output is diffed, or by binding references to a declarative component (if you don't know what that means yet, don't worry, that's what this guide is for!).\n",
    "\n",
    "This data-driven and declarative nature allows succinct expression of how a change in some input value should be reflected in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How is Reactivity implemented in Param?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reactivity in Param is achieved through so called \"references\". A reference binds some state uni-directionally to a parameter on another object, i.e. we can bind the `value` parameter of a widget to some other widget:"

    "- Simple, inline transformations: This is where they shine, you have a boolean value and just need to negate it before binding it as a reference? Perfect and simple.\n",
    "- Data Transformation: Pandas and other data libraries are arguably best used using method-chaining approaches and `rx` is a natural extension of that. Need to filter some data, multiply some columns and then compute the mean? Again, perfect, simple and clean and you can reuse the result thanks to the automatic caching.\n",
    "- Branching workflows: Say you have a dataset, want to transform or filter it dynamically, and then compute a bunch of different statistics from the same subset of the data. Thanks to caching of the intermediate values it is simple, clear and efficient to compute the derived statistics. \n",

Helpers like `.rx.when` or `.rx.where` can help with simple conditional cases but as soon as you have some complex chain of these it becomes very difficult to reason about.\n",
    "- Large Data: One of the biggest strengths of expressions is that they automatically perform caching, particularly useful for branching workflows, but for large data this can start working against you. Since intermediate results are cached, and Pandas is not always transparent about when it makes a copy of your data, you can end up with multiple copies of your large dataset in memory."
